Decision Rule
 Based on the Schelling model, the decision rule for an agent to move is that if the proportion of same-group neighbors (including itself) is less than the tolerance, then the agent will move to a random empty cell in the grid.

Study
Generate a 20x20 grid with 200 agents.
Run the simulation for 50 iterations.
Test two levels of tolerance: low and high. The low tolerance level will be 0.2, and the high tolerance level will be 0.8.
Test two different group sizes: equal-sized and unequal-sized. For the equal-sized group, we will divide the grid into two equal groups of 100 agents. For the unequal-sized group, we will divide the grid into one group of 150 agents and another group of 50 agents.
Measure the level of segregation in the grid after each iteration using the Schelling index.
Plot the Schelling index over time for each simulation.
Analyze and compare the results for each simulation and discuss the findings.
